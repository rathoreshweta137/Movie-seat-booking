Project Name: Movie Seat Booking
Movie Seat Booking is a web application that allows users to select and book seats for a movie. The project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

You will see the movie seat booking page, which includes the following elements:

Movie Selection Dropdown: Choose a movie from the dropdown menu to display the available seating arrangement for that movie.
Seating Arrangement: The seats are displayed in rows and columns. Click on an available seat to select it. Click on a selected seat to deselect it.
Pricing Summary: The pricing summary section shows the number of selected seats and the total price. The price may vary based on the movie selection and the seat location.
Disabled Seats: Occupied seats are disabled and cannot be selected.

Technologies Used
HTML: The markup language used to define the structure of the page.
CSS: The styling language used to customize the appearance of the elements.
JavaScript: The programming language used to provide interactivity and logic to the application.

I will further convert this site in mobile app for booking movie tickets .
